# ðŸŒ¿ Anjali's Prompt Journal

Welcome to my prompt journal â€” a personal space where I collect prompts that have helped me reflect, grow, heal, and create.

Iâ€™m not starting from perfection. Iâ€™m starting from **scratch, soul, and self-awareness**.  
This repo is a way to document my journey â€” both personal and technical â€” as I evolve through life and learning.

### âœ¨ What's Inside:
- ðŸ’¬ Prompts Iâ€™ve used with ChatGPT to process emotions, plan my life, reflect deeply
- ðŸ““ Thought fragments from everyday moments and midnight realizations
- ðŸ§  Raw ideas for future content, tools, stories, or creations

## ðŸ›¤ Why Iâ€™m Doing This

Iâ€™m on a journey that hasnâ€™t always been straightforward.  
But Iâ€™ve realized â€” I donâ€™t need a perfect past to build a meaningful future.  
This repo is my way of turning curiosity, emotion, and reflection into something tangible.  
I believe that **what we write can shape who we become**.  
This is meâ€¦ shaping.

## ðŸŒ± More to Come

If youâ€™re reading this, thank you for being a witness to the beginning.
